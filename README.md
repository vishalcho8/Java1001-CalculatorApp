Project: Calculator App

Description: This app will perform following basic mathmatic operations:
           1. Addition
           2. Subtraction
           3. Multiplication
           4. Division
           5. Suqare
           6. Square Root
           7. Inverse (1 Divided by given number.)
           
 Note:
 1. User is expected to click on Clear button before proceeding for the next operation after each operation is done.
 2. If CLear button is not clicked, result of previous operation will be used as a first input.


 Ex. When clear button is not clicked:
 
 
     //First time
     Edit text: 0 (Initially)
     30+40
     O/P: 70

     //Second time
     - 40    (No need to provide first input. Here 70 will be used as the first input from previous result)
     O/P: 30 (70 - 40)


 Ex. When clear button is clicked:
 
 
     //First time
     Edit text: 0 (Initially)
     30+40
     O/P: 70

    //Second time
    70 - 40    (Explicitly need to provide first input i.e 70 in this case since previous result has been vanished.)
    O/P: 30
